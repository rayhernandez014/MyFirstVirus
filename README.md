# MyFirstVirus
This is a code that emulates the behavior of a simple virus, created with didactic purposes.
It's written in Python, and is based in a Youtube Tutorial from the channel "NeuralNine": https://youtu.be/qNy_amMuVZQ
I added multithreading to avoid the actual "malicious code" to affect the "original code" functionality.

This virus does not have the capability to (and was not created to) manifest a real malicious behavior, neither to be useful in a real cyberattack. This was created just to study the basic logic of a virus.
